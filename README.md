This repository implements the A* pathfinding algorithm in Python. A* is a popular and efficient search algorithm used to find the shortest path between two points on a grid while avoiding obstacles.

Features:

-Implements A* search for pathfinding.

-Supports diagonal and non-diagonal movement.

-Incorporates a customizable heuristic function for adaptability to different grid configurations.

-Detects and avoids obstacles on the grid.

-Slows down the program to help visualize how the program goes through the maze to solve it efficently.
